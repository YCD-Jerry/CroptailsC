Marlow: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], nice to meet you.
Marlow: Welcome to your new farm.
Marlow: You can chop the trees and rocks with your axe.
Marlow: As you can see the cows and chickens are hungry.
Marlow: You need to grow some crops to feed them.
Marlow: You can till the land before you grow crops.
Marlow: After you grow your crops, you can speed the game up, so the crops will grow faster after you water them.
Marlow: BTWï¼Œthere are some apples in this land! Try to find all the 8 apples! I just spotted one near the chickens!
Marlow: Here are some seeds to grow some crops.
